AI-Powered Accessibility for Visually Impaired

**Overview**

This project aims to empower visually impaired individuals by providing them with an AI-powered tool to assist with real-time scene analysis, text extraction, and text-to-speech conversion. The goal is to enhance the autonomy and independence of visually impaired users by leveraging advanced AI models in an intuitive and user-friendly interface.

**Problem Statement**

Visually impaired individuals face significant challenges in navigating public spaces, reading visual content, and interacting with their surroundings. Everyday tasks, such as reading a menu, recognizing a friend's face, or understanding the environment, can be overwhelming and frustrating. This project seeks to provide a solution that offers real-time assistance to enhance the independence of these individuals.

**Key Features**
- **Scene Interpretation**: AI-powered scene analysis to describe the environment and objects around the user.
- **Text Extraction**: Use of OCR (Optical Character Recognition) to extract text from images and documents.
- **Text-to-Speech**: Converted text is read aloud, making information accessible to users with visual impairments.
- **Real-Time Assistance**: The system provides timely feedback and suggestions, offering a seamless experience.

**Objectives**
- Enhance accessibility for visually impaired individuals.
- Implement scene interpretation using AI models to describe surroundings.
- Extract text from images or documents using OCR.
- Develop a user-friendly interface for easy interaction.
- Utilize advanced AI technologies to deliver reliable results.
